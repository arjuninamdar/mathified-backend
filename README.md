# Mathified Backend

This Git repo contains the backend code for Mathified. There is a .SQL file which constructs the database, and the code itself is written using Spring Framework, a Java based framework. The frontend code can be found on my Github page under the repo "mathified-frontend."

Mathified is a site which connects exprienced mathematicians to students who need help with math related concepts. This website arose after I had many conceptual questions which weren't easily satisfied: I had to post on various forums, only to recieve one clear answer, if lucky. This site has a select network of tutors dedicated to answering the problems users may post.
